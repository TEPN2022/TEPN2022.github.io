## SCOPE AND  TOPICS  OF  INTEREST

<p align="justify">
Supported by the development of several testbed facilities including Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR), Cloudlab, GENI, FABRIC, Chameleon, and US-European EMPOWER, researchers are able to pursue programmable network experiments across the mobile edge, core networks and the cloud.  The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from wireless networking, cloud computing, distributed computing, security, and autonomous systems to share their experiences and lessons learned from using these testbeds, challenges toward implementing at-scale experiments, discuss ideas to integrate experiments across multiple platforms, and facilitate the broader use of developed experiments and collected datasets with the community. 
</p>

### Topics of Interest:

  - Experiments using public platforms (e.g., PAWR, FABRIC, EMPOWER)
  - Cross-testbed experiments 
  - Evaluation of using wireless testbeds related to cellular networks, UAV systems, robotic systems, IoT systems
  - Experimental evaluation of end-to-end (mobile edge, cloud) programmable networks
  - Wired and wireless communication architecture and topologies for end-to-end programmable networks
  - Experimental evaluation of privacy and security in end-to-end programmable networks
  - Trust management in programmable networks
  - Experimental evaluation of resiliency in programmable networks
  - Machine learning for programmable networks
  - Data sharing, and benchmarking in using cross-testbed experiments
